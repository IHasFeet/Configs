#This set of commands will setup 
#	OpenVAS
#		i3
#		xRDP
#		Firefox
#		nmap
#		netdiscover

#The aim is to take you from an Ubuntu server to a remotely accessible GUI,
#to allow you to run a vulnerability scan, and perform some basic pen tests
#
#xRDP will allow you to use multiple monitors if that is your client configuration.
#
#Execute by running the below command
#sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IHasFeet/Configs/master/pentesttools/setuppentesttools -O ~/setuppentesttools && bash setuppentesttools
#
#You can run this file multiple times without causing issues.
#Perhaps run it twice if your OS hasn't been upgraded for a while?
#
#
#
#
#	This script will first run the OpenVAS installer, and then add to it...

#IHasFeet 2020
#This set of commands will setup OpenVAS, i3, xRDP and Firefox
#
#The aim is to take you from an Ubuntu server to a remotely accessible GUI,
#to allow you to run the vulnerability scan, and view the results.
#
#xRDP will allow you to use multiple monitors if that is your client configuration.
#
#Execute by running the below command
#sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IHasFeet/Configs/master/setup_OpenVAS/setupopenvas -O ~/setupopenvas && bash setupopenvas
#
#You can run this file multiple times without causing issues.
#Perhaps run it twice if your OS hasn't been upgraded for a while?
